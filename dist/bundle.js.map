If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\nvar curryN = /*#__PURE__*/_curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\nexport default curryN;","import _curry1 from './_curry1';\nimport _curry2 from './_curry2';\nimport _isPlaceholder from './_isPlaceholder';\n\n/**\n * Optimized internal three-arity curry function.\n *\n * @private\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} The curried function.\n */\nexport default function _curry3(fn) {\n  return function f3(a, b, c) {\n    switch (arguments.length) {\n      case 0:\n        return f3;\n      case 1:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) ? f3 : _curry2(function (_b, _c) {\n          return fn(a, _b, _c);\n        });\n      case 2:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(b) ? f3 : _isPlaceholder(a) ? _curry2(function (_a, _c) {\n          return fn(_a, b, _c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(b) ? _curry2(function (_b, _c) {\n          return fn(a, _b, _c);\n        }) : _curry1(function (_c) {\n          return fn(a, b, _c);\n        });\n      default:\n        return _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(b) && _isPlaceholder(c) ? f3 : _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(b) ? _curry2(function (_a, _b) {\n          return fn(_a, _b, c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(a) && _isPlaceholder(c) ? _curry2(function (_a, _c) {\n          return fn(_a, b, _c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(b) && _isPlaceholder(c) ? _curry2(function (_b, _c) {\n          return fn(a, _b, _c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(a) ? _curry1(function (_a) {\n          return fn(_a, b, c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(b) ? _curry1(function (_b) {\n          return fn(a, _b, c);\n        }) : _isPlaceholder(c) ? _curry1(function (_c) {\n          return fn(a, b, _c);\n        }) : fn(a, b, c);\n    }\n  };\n}","import _concat from './internal/_concat';\nimport _curry3 from './internal/_curry3';\n\n/**\n * Applies a function to the value at the given index of an array, returning a\n * new copy of the array with the element at the given index replaced with the\n * result of the function application.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.14.0\n * @category List\n * @sig (a -> a) -> Number -> [a] -> [a]\n * @param {Function} fn The function to apply.\n * @param {Number} idx The index.\n * @param {Array|Arguments} list An array-like object whose value\n *        at the supplied index will be replaced.\n * @return {Array} A copy of the supplied array-like object with\n *         the element at index `idx` replaced with the value\n *         returned by applying `fn` to the existing element.\n * @see R.update\n * @example\n *\n *      R.adjust(R.add(10), 1, [1, 2, 3]);     //=> [1, 12, 3]\n *      R.adjust(R.add(10))(1)([1, 2, 3]);     //=> [1, 12, 3]\n * @symb R.adjust(f, -1, [a, b]) = [a, f(b)]\n * @symb R.adjust(f, 0, [a, b]) = [f(a), b]\n */\nvar adjust = /*#__PURE__*/_curry3(function adjust(fn, idx, list) {\n  if (idx >= list.length || idx < -list.length) {\n    return list;\n  }\n  var start = idx < 0 ? list.length : 0;\n  var _idx = start + idx;\n  var _list = _concat(list);\n  _list[_idx] = fn(list[_idx]);\n  return _list;\n});\nexport default adjust;","/**\n * Tests whether or not an object is an array.\n *\n * @private\n * @param {*} val The object to test.\n * @return {Boolean} `true` if `val` is an array, `false` otherwise.\n * @example\n *\n *      _isArray([]); //=> true\n *      _isArray(null); //=> false\n *      _isArray({}); //=> false\n */\nexport default Array.isArray || function _isArray(val) {\n  return val != null && val.length >= 0 && Object.prototype.toString.call(val) === '[object Array]';\n};","export default function _isTransformer(obj) {\n  return typeof obj['@@transducer/step'] === 'function';\n}","import _isArray from './_isArray';\nimport _isTransformer from './_isTransformer';\n\n/**\n * Returns a function that dispatches with different strategies based on the\n * object in list position (last argument).
